# Azure Storage Account with a File Share for SQLite database persistence.
# PR TEST: trigger Azure OpenAI security check - permissions fix test
# The Container App mounts this share at /app/data.
#TEST
# Note: SQLite over Azure File Share (SMB) works for single-instance bots.
# For multi-instance or high-throughput, migrate to Azure SQL or Cosmos DB.

#checkov:skip=CKV_AZURE_59:EXC-002 Storage network rules omitted — Function App Consumption plan (Y1) uses shared Azure infrastructure without VNet injection support. Access key stored in Key Vault. See docs/compliance/exceptions-registry.json.
#checkov:skip=CKV_AZURE_35:EXC-002 Same as CKV_AZURE_59 — network ACL Deny would block Function App runtime on Y1 plan.
